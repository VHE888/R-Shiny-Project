## Description

This application is an RShiny app designed to analyze RNA-Seq data from Huntington's Disease and healthy brain tissue. The app includes four main components:

1.  **Sample Information Exploration**: Summary tables and distribution plots of sample information.
2.  **Counts Matrix Exploration**: Count filtering, scatterplots, clustered heatmap, and PCA.
3.  **Differential Expression Analysis**: Volcano plot and DEG table with significant adjusted p-values.
4.  **Gene Set Enrichment Analysis**: Barplot of top pathways, downloadable table of significantly enriched pathways, and scatterplot of NES vs. p-value.

You can use the testing data provided in the 'data' folder and access the app through the code in the 'app' folder.

## GEO Dataset
